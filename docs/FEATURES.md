# Features

This file is the current feature inventory for the source tree. The original
SDD remains the baseline design, but the implementation now includes later
extensions for multi-tenancy, administration, bulk ingest, KG visualization,
and provider support.

Legend:

- `yes`: implemented and covered by direct or integration tests.
- `partial`: implemented but limited by deployment mode, optional extras, or
  indirect coverage.
- `no`: intentionally not shipped or still a known gap.

## Provider Matrix

| Provider | Core | Frontier | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `openai` | yes | yes | OpenAI-compatible adapter. |
| `openai_compat` | yes | yes | Requires explicit `api_base`. |
| `openai_responses` | yes | yes | Production default: Muse Spark through OpenCode Go. |
| `ollama` | yes | yes | Local Ollama at `http://localhost:11434/v1`. |

## Cache And Storage Guarantees

- Filesystem memory files are authoritative.
- Neo4j and the in-memory KG are derived indexes.
- PostgreSQL is the control plane for events, outboxes, bulk jobs, recovery state,
  consolidation tasks, tenants, and audit rows.
- The session cache stores active conversation state only and is tenant-scoped.
- Embedding and overview caches are post-SDD performance extensions. They are
  disposable, non-authoritative, and must not be used as durable memory.

## Known Limits

- BM25-assisted duplicate classification is not implemented in the current
  conflict resolver. The shipped resolver uses exact URI/cosine/Core-model
  conflict decisions.
- Hard-delete of memories is not exposed; memory retirement is soft-delete.
- Active/active multi-region replication is not shipped.
- Training scripts are runnable with optional extras, but this repo does not
  include a validated trained adapter artifact.
- Some retained historical docs may lag the newest Admin UI, bulk upload, KG
  visualization, and Ollama Cloud surfaces. Treat this file, root `README.md`,
  and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as the current overview.
