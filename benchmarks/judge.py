"""LLM-as-judge scorer for the LoCoMo baseline.

LoCoMo answers are free-form ("Psychology, counseling certification"), so a
string match cannot decide correctness -- Engram may phrase the same fact
completely differently. We ask a model to grade semantic equivalence instead.

Judge model: Muse Spark through the OpenCode Go Responses API, matching
Engram's production model path.

Two grading modes:

* Normal questions -> correct iff the prediction conveys the reference answer
  (value-level match for dates/numbers, meaning-level for text).

* Adversarial questions (category 5, ~446 of them) -> the question is NOT
  answerable from the conversation, so the ONLY correct behaviour is abstention.
  A confident fabricated answer is marked wrong even though it is fluent text.
  This is the abstention signal that maps onto Engram's frontier "can't answer"
  path, so grading it correctly matters.
